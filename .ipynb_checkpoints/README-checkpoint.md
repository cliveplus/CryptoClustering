# CryptoClustering
## In this challenge, we used our knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

Sections of the challenge include:
1. Prepare the Data
2. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame
3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data
4. Optimise Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
5. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
6. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
